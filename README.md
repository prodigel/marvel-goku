# Marvel / Goku test
This repository is a simple implementation of the Marvel/Goku "challenge" using open API's available.
Unfortunately Marvel emails didn't reach me when attempting to setup the connection, thus I switched to the alternative one: Dragon Ball Z API.

I left below the basic instructions to setup and run the application. Enjoy!

## Technical details
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to test the application

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
